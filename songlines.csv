It's the same old song,Dio
you gotta be somewhere at sometime,Dio
and they'll never let you fly,Dio
It's like broken glass,Dio
you get cut before you see it,Dio
so open up your eyes,Dio
You've got desire,Dio
so let it out,Dio
you've got the power,Dio
stand up and shout,Dio
"shout, shout, stand up and shout",Dio
You got wings of steel,Dio
but they never really move you,Dio
you only seem to crawl,Dio
You've been nailed to the wheel,Dio
but never really turning,Dio
you know you've got to work it out,Dio
You've got desire,Dio
so let it out,Dio
you've got the power,Dio
stand up and shout,Dio
"shout, shout, stand up and shout",Dio
Let it out,Dio
You are the strongest chain,Dio
and you're not just some reflection,Dio
so never hide again,Dio
You are the driver,Dio
you own the road,Dio
"you are the fire -- go on, explode",Dio
Let it out,Dio
Stand up and shout,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
You've been down too long in the midnight sea,Dio
Oh what's becoming of me,Dio
Ride the tiger,Dio
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean,Dio
Oh don't you see what I mean,Dio
Gotta get away,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
Shiny diamonds,Dio
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue,Dio
Something is coming for you,Dio
Race for the morning,Dio
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light,Dio
Oh we will pray it's all right,Dio
Gotta get away-get away,Dio
Between the velvet lies,Dio
There's a truth that's hard as steel,Dio
The vision never dies,Dio
Life's a never ending wheel,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
You're the star of the masquerade,Dio
No need to look so afraid,Dio
Jump on the tiger,Dio
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean,Dio
Some light can never be seen,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
You've been down too long in the midnight sea,Dio
Oh what's becoming of me,Dio
Ride the tiger,Dio
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean,Dio
Oh don't you see what I mean,Dio
Gotta get away,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
Yeah gypsy,Dio
She was straight from hell,Dio
But you never could tell,Dio
'cause you were blinded by her light,Dio
She could crack your brain,Dio
With magic pain,Dio
And turn a paler shade of white,Dio
"Well, I was on the free, just me and me",Dio
And just about to sail,Dio
When I heard the voice saying,Dio
You've got a choice,Dio
The hammer or the nail,Dio
You'll be ridin',Dio
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy,Dio
I'm a gypsy,Dio
Well I rolled the bones,Dio
To see who'd own,Dio
My mind and what's within,Dio
And it's a given rule,Dio
That we're all fools,Dio
But need to have a little sin,Dio
So I'm ridin',Dio
"Well, I'm ridin' on the gypsy",Dio
On the gypsy queen,Dio
"Well, she was straight from hell",Dio
But you never could tell,Dio
'cause you were blinded by her light,Dio
And so she cracked my brain,Dio
With magic pain,Dio
"And turned my left around to right, right",Dio
So I'm ridin',Dio
"I'm still ridin',",Dio
"Yes, I'm ridin' on, on the gypsy",Dio
On the gypsy queen,Dio
She's mean,Dio
Looking inside of yourself,Dio
You might see someone you don't know ooh ooh,Dio
Maybe it's just what you need,Dio
Letting the river in you flow,Dio
You can sail away to the sun,Dio
And let it burn you while it can,Dio
I walk along the bloody road,Dio
Like the hero who never ends,Dio
"You'll feel it,",Dio
You'll feel it,Dio
You'll feel the rush of it all,Dio
Oh ooh oh oh oh oh,Dio
Flying away in the clouds,Dio
You're no more losing your control ooh,Dio
And finding your way in the dark,Dio
Like some poor forgotten soul,Dio
"You'll feel it,",Dio
"You'll see it,",Dio
You'll feel the rush of the city lights,Dio
"I feel it,",Dio
I see it in your eyes,Dio
You're caught in the middle,Dio
Just like the way you've always been,Dio
Caught in the middle,Dio
Helpless again,Dio
Looking inside of yourself,Dio
You might see someone you don't know ooh ooh,Dio
Maybe it's just what you need,Dio
Letting the river of nowhere send you flow,Dio
You can feel it,Dio
You can see it,Dio
"You'll know the rush of thunder, yeah",Dio
You'll feel it,Dio
I see it in your eyes,Dio
You're caught in the middle,Dio
Just like the way you've always been,Dio
Caught in the middle,Dio
Helpless again,Dio
Like the rush of a thunder,Dio
That brings you under,Dio
There's some kind of spark,Dio
You're caught right there in the middle,Dio
You're caught in the middle,Dio
Caught in the middle again,Dio
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm,Dio
You're feeling caught in the middle,Dio
Don't talk to strangers hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm,Dio
Don't talk to strangers,Dio
'Cause they're only there to do you harm,Dio
Don't write in starlight,Dio
'Cause the words may come out real,Dio
Don't hide in doorways,Dio
You may find the key that opens up your soul,Dio
Don't go to heaven,Dio
'Cause it's really only hell,Dio
Don't smell the flowers,Dio
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind,Dio
Don't dream of women,Dio
'Cause they'll only bring you down,Dio
"Hey, you, you know me",Dio
You can touch me. I'm real,Dio
I'm forever,Dio
The one that lets you look and see,Dio
And feel me,Dio
"I'm danger, I'm the stranger",Dio
"And I, I'm darkness",Dio
"I'm anger, I'm pain,",Dio
I'm the master,Dio
The evil song you sing inside your brain,Dio
Drive you insane,Dio
Don't talk,Dio
Don't let them inside your mind yeah,Dio
"Run away, run away, go",Dio
"No, no, don't let them in your mind",Dio
Protect your soul,Dio
Don't dance in darkness,Dio
You may stumble and you're sure to fall,Dio
Don't write in starlight,Dio
'Cause the words may come out real,Dio
Don't talk to strangers (don't talk),Dio
'Cause they're only there to make you sad,Dio
Don't dream of women,Dio
'Cause they'll only bring you down yeah,Dio
"Run, run, run, run away",Dio
Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind,Dio
"it looks like a long, long way to fall",Dio
No one ever told me life was kind,Dio
I guess I never heard it,Dio
I never heard it all,Dio
Living in a world of make believe,Dio
I can hide behind what's real,Dio
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve,Dio
and they all know what you feel,Dio
And here it comes again,Dio
straight through the heart,Dio
straight through the heart,Dio
"Oh, never tell a secret",Dio
with your eyes,Dio
it's the eyes that let you down,Dio
Tell a little truth with many lies,Dio
it's the only way I've found,Dio
"Oh, here it comes again",Dio
straight through the heart,Dio
straight through the heart,Dio
Shout to the wind,Dio
how can you hurt me this way,Dio
"Oh, once it begins",Dio
it looks like it's coming to stay,Dio
Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind,Dio
"it looks like a long, long way to fall",Dio
No one ever told me life was kind,Dio
I guess I never heard it,Dio
I never heard it all,Dio
in the middle of the heart,Dio
"No, don't stand still",Dio
they'll get you right through your heart,Dio
here it comes,Dio
here it comes again,Dio
straight through the heart,Dio
If your circle stays unbroken,Dio
then you're a lucky man,Dio
"'cause it never, never, never has for me",Dio
In the palace of the virgin,Dio
lies the chalice of the soul,Dio
and it's likely you might find the answer there,Dio
She had thirteen years of teenage tears,Dio
never a helping hand,Dio
She had fourteen more of rain before,Dio
she saw the sight of land,Dio
She was a photograph just ripped in half,Dio
a smile inside a frown,Dio
And then the light,Dio
the answer right inside her coming down,Dio
She said,Dio
I can go away I can leave here,Dio
I can be invisible,Dio
I'll go away,Dio
He was just eighteen and in between,Dio
a lady and a man,Dio
His daddy's girl in momma's world,Dio
that was when he ran,Dio
"you know the word ""confused"" has been abused",Dio
but that's just what he was,Dio
And in the spark inside the dark,Dio
"the answer came to call it said,",Dio
You can go away,Dio
you can leave here,Dio
you can be be be invisible,Dio
"Well, I grew up quick and I felt the kick of life upon a stage",Dio
So I bought the book and took a fast look,Dio
at just the very last page,Dio
It was a single word that I'd just heard,Dio
from the two that came before,Dio
The only way to really stay,Dio
is to walk right out the door,Dio
So you can go away,Dio
I'm gonna leave here,Dio
I can be invisible and go away again,Dio
I can go away when I leave here,Dio
I can be invisible,Dio
I said when I've gone away,Dio
lord you know it's right to leave here,Dio
So I just became invisible,Dio
"I went away,",Dio
I disappeared before your eyes.,Dio
You never touch me you never feel me,Dio
you'll never see me again,Dio
because I've just become unseen,Dio
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half,Dio
we're all eighteen and we're in between,Dio
We need a helping hand to the holy land,Dio
to be invisible,Dio
to go away,Dio
When there's lightning,Dio
You know it always bring me down,Dio
'Cause it's free,Dio
And I see,Dio
That it's me who's lost and never found,Dio
I cry out for magic,Dio
I feel it dancing in the light,Dio
"It was cold,",Dio
Lost my hold,Dio
To the shadows of the night,Dio
No sign of the morning coming,Dio
You've been left on your own,Dio
Like a rainbow in the dark,Dio
A rainbow in the dark,Dio
"Do your demons,",Dio
Do they ever let you go?,Dio
When you've tried,Dio
Do they hide,Dio
Deep inside. Is it someone that you know?,Dio
You're just a picture,Dio
You're an image caught in time,Dio
We're a lie,Dio
You and I,Dio
We're words without a rhyme,Dio
There's no sign of the morning coming,Dio
You've been left on your own,Dio
Like a rainbow in the dark,Dio
Just a rainbow in the dark yeah,Dio
When i see lightning,Dio
You know it always brings me down,Dio
'Cause it's free,Dio
And I see,Dio
That it's me who's lost and never found,Dio
Feel the magic,Dio
I feel it floating in the air,Dio
But it's fear,Dio
And you'll hear,Dio
It callingâyou bewareâlook out,Dio
There's no sign of the morning coming,Dio
There's no sign of the day,Dio
You've been left on your own,Dio

I see clearly who's behind the wall yes I can see us all,Dio
We're faces in the window noises in the night,Dio
Faces in the window hiding from the light faces in the window,Dio
Give me shelter shelter shelter give me shelter shelter shelter,Dio
Faces in the window noises in the night faces in the window hiding from the light,Dio
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window,Dio
When the fire starts to die and you open up your eyes there they are in the window faces in the window,Dio
We are evil and divine just creations of the mind and faces in the window faces in the window,Dio
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window,Dio
Oh rain falls thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky everywhere,Dio
Stars move they're shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries,Dio
Fire burning through your brain turn to face the train oh oh,Dio
Hey it's magic said the mother to the child it's stronger than a smile let it go,Dio
When a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah when a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah,Dio
Just when you think it's pretend here it comes over and over again,Dio
And if we should live forever maybe we'll still just never know oh oh,Dio
Oh rain falls thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky everywhere,Dio
Stars move shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries,Dio
Fire magic shakin' all the earth when a woman cries,Dio
Oh oh stars move thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky when a woman cries,Dio
When a woman cries aah when a woman cries yeah yeah ,Dio
When a woman cries when a woman cries oh,Dio
You say you've never seen the light before,Dio
Does anyone believe you,Dio
Don't let them hear you say anymore,Dio
Nothing's really safe around here,Dio
We are an imitation of the crown,Dio
We never turn the pages,Dio
They cannot let your spirit touch the ground,Dio
"And nothing's gonna change around here, no",Dio
Crack in the ceiling,Dio
Hole in the wall,Dio
They bend you over,Dio
But you won't crawl away,Dio
You've got two in the bushes,Dio
One in the hand,Dio
They'd make you over,Dio
But they can't understand you,Dio
You're always gonna be the wild one,Dio
Pretend that all you really feel is pain,Dio
Just hide behind some sorrow,Dio
How sad,Dio
But you'd do it all again,Dio
(I guess that) Nobody changes 'round here,Dio
Cat in the cradle,Dio
Man in the moon,Dio
They'd make you over,Dio
"But it's too soon to know, no",Dio
Smoke in the kitchen,Dio
Fire in the hall,Dio
The train is coming,Dio
And you can hear it calling,Dio
You're always gonna be the wild one,Dio
Crack in the ceiling,Dio
Hole in the wall,Dio
They bend you over,Dio
But you won't crawl away,Dio
You've got two in the bushes,Dio
One in the hand,Dio
They'd make you over,Dio
But they can't understand you,Dio
You're always gonna be the Wild One,Dio
There's a crack in the rainbow,Dio
There's a hole in the sky,Dio
You believed in something,Dio
"Now it's just a lie, yeah",Dio
No jokes from the jester,Dio
Not a laugh from the clown,Dio
"And your world is upside down, yeah",Dio
You can hide in a circle,Dio
It's a way to survive,Dio
Be another number,Dio
At least you'd be alive,Dio
Or you can ride with the gypsy,Dio
He can take you to hell,Dio
And the answers screaming,Dio
In a voice you know so well,Dio
You - you're made of fire,Dio
Never higher,Dio
You were made to run,Dio
You - you're burning higher,Dio
You've got the fire,Dio
You were born on the sun,Dio
So take a walk with a wild one,Dio
It's the way that I've found,Dio
You can turn it upside down,Dio
How do you feel right now,Dio
How does it feel to be alone,Dio
How do you feel right now,Dio
Tell me,Dio
Hey angel - what's your situation,Dio
"Hey angel - oh, oh",Dio
Where would you be right now,Dio
Waiting to taste your next tomorrow,Dio
Where would you be right now,Dio
Tell me,Dio
Was the pain too strong to take it anymore,Dio
So you turned off all the lights and shut the door,Dio
Hey angel - what's your destination,Dio
Hey angel,Dio
Hey angel - we got a complication,Dio
"Hey angel - oh, oh - you're my angel, my angel",Dio
How do you feel right now,Dio
"How does it feel to be alone, oh",Dio
How do you feel right now,Dio
How do you feel right now,Dio
"Oh angel - you're my angel, oh my angel,...",Dio
She never breaks into the conversation,Dio
He seems to be the reason why she lives,Dio
She tries to be the perfect kind of stranger,Dio
But we always seem to love the most,Dio
"The ones who never give, yeah",Dio
It's between two hearts,Dio
A personal situation,Dio
Between two hearts,Dio
The kind of love with a reputation,Dio
We never have to ask her why she's crying,Dio
The smile she had's been kicked into a frown,Dio
But still it makes her day to be his pleasure,Dio
Should we open up her eyes,Dio
Can we ever break the spell,Dio
No one can tell,Dio
It's between two hearts,Dio
A personal combination,Dio
Between too hearts,Dio
The kind of love with a bad reputation,Dio
Put on your party faces and come along,Dio
Join in the big parade,Dio
Here comes the camera,Dio
Do you look as good as your sister,Dio
Smile at the animals,Dio
They should be the ones in the cages,Dio
Turn the pages,Dio
Another way to spend a rainy Sunday,Dio
Waiting for a call that never comes,Dio
The mystery is how she makes her choices,Dio
But don't we always choose,Dio
The ones who hide the sun,Dio
Everyone,Dio
It's between two hearts,Dio
Love and desperation,Dio
Between two hearts,Dio
The kind of love,Dio
The kind of love,Dio
Between two hearts,Dio
A personal situation,Dio
Between two hearts,Dio
The kind of love with a reputation,Dio
Looking on the(?) side,Dio
You're waiting for your life to walk away,Dio
Writings on a wall,Dio
"You just dream forever, forever",Dio
Face it - it's another day,Dio
And it's gonna be the same tomorrow,Dio
The sun is gonna go away,Dio
"So let it shine on - shine on, yeah, yeah",Dio
When you move to the rhythm of shadows,Dio
You can hide from the heat of the sun,Dio
'Cos If you dance to the beat of the darkness,Dio
You burn before the fire's begun,Dio
Then comes the night,Dio
You come alive,Dio
With night music,Dio
It keeps spinning around my head,Dio
Night music,Dio
It's all the things that you never said,Dio
And anywhere you are,Dio
There's night music,Dio
So open up your arms,Dio
Let the night time in,Dio
Say the word and it begins,Dio
In the night you're the song and the singer,Dio
You can choose what the band's gonna play,Dio
"Write the words under cover of moonlight, oh",Dio
Make some magic with the things that you say,Dio
Together we can kill the day,Dio
Night music,Dio
You're singer and I'm the song,Dio
Night music,Dio
Where's the place we can belong,Dio
Here comes the night,Dio
You will survive,Dio
Dancing in the moonlight,Dio
Makes you feel alive,Dio
Open your arms,Dio
Let it begin,Dio
Just open up the magic,Dio
Let the night time in,Dio
In the houses of the holy,Dio
To the middle of the mystic sea,Dio
At the cradle of the world,Dio
There's a black cat screaming,Dio
"And it's not even midnight, no",Dio
At the cradle of the world,Dio
They're screaming for sanctuary,Dio
They're screaming at you,Dio
Lock up the wolves,Dio
"Lock up the wolves, yeah, yeah, yeah",Dio
Now there's a cloud over heaven,Dio
And a pain out of paradise,Dio
In your corner of the world,Dio
Turn your back on the children,Dio
Does it feel like it's colder,Dio
In your corner of the world,Dio
They're screaming for sanctuary,Dio
They're screaming at you,Dio
Lock up the wolves,Dio
"Lock up the wolves,...",Dio
Don't you let'em get away,Dio
Lock up the wolves before you play,Dio
Or it's over,Dio
Lock up the wolves,Dio
Don't you let'em get away,Dio
Don't you let'em get away,Dio
There's no back door to heaven,Dio
"Just a front door to hell, oh",Dio
In this corner of the world,Dio
Now if you turn your back on the children,Dio
Don't you feel it getting colder,Dio
In your corner of the world,Dio
They're screaming for sanctuary,Dio
They're screaming at you,Dio
Lock up the wolves,Dio
"Lock up the wolves,...",Dio
Spent the night on the road,Dio
And never saw the miles go,Dio
Running away,Dio
I've got to get free from myself,Dio
How stories were made to be told,Dio
And here's the one that I know,Dio
I can't hide it anymore,Dio
There's evil on Queen Street,Dio
I saw the house in the dark,Dio
"It seemed to say ""come touch me",Dio
I've got a heart,Dio
"Open the door to my soul""",Dio
Climb to the top of my stairs,Dio
And look into my windows,Dio
I can be your wishing well,Dio
There's no evil on Queen Street,Dio
Let me in,Dio
I can warm in the heat of your fire,Dio
It's no permanent sin to be bad,Dio
If you're sorry,Dio
Let me go - you're a promise that comes from a liar,Dio
"I don't know - if I ever can wash all the evil away, hey",Dio
Struck a match at the dark,Dio
"It screamed no, no I love you",Dio
Together we're strong,Dio
"You always believed what I'd say, hey",Dio
But now the heat of a flame,Dio
Starts me to remember,Dio
There's no evil - no more evil,Dio
No evil on Queen Street,Dio
Just smoke in the air,Dio
No evil anywhere,Dio
No evil on Queen Street,Dio
He's just an ordinary man,Dio
Never gonna live forever,Dio
So he takes it where he can,Dio
Too many nights without a day,Dio
For the sake of being clever,Dio
He almost lost his way,Dio
He always thought that he could fly,Dio
Till he was shot down from the sky,Dio
You can't walk on water - don't try,Dio
You can't walk on water - my my my,Dio
They say there's ice inside his veins,Dio
He's the man of a thousand faces,Dio
Silver spoons and golden chains,Dio
He thought his heart was made of steel,Dio
But it never started pounding,Dio
Till they strapped him to the wheel,Dio
He always thought that he could fly,Dio
Till he was shot down from the sky,Dio
No matter what you try,Dio
You can't walk on water - my my,Dio
Can't walk on water - don't let me try,Dio
Somebody said we'll make him strong,Dio
He can give us all the answers,Dio
Tell us right and show us wrong,Dio
"If you believe it, it's no lie",Dio
And there is an end to summer,Dio
'Cause the winter makes it die,Dio
We never looked above his head,Dio
"And so he missed the things that they said, yeah",Dio
He always thought that he could fly,Dio
Until they shot him from the sky,Dio
No matter how you try,Dio
You can't walk on water,Dio
Can't burn the sun,Dio
You can't walk on water,Dio
Not anyone,Dio
"You can't, you can't, you can't",Dio
"You can't, you can't, walk on water",Dio
It's just a matter of time,Dio
He was the victim and he never saw the crime,Dio
He had invisible eyes,Dio
"He told you truth but you were sure of it, lies",Dio
'Cause he was twisted (you could see it),Dio
"He was twisted, all right",Dio
He was the fortunate one,Dio
He could have pulled the trigger,Dio
But he couldn't get the gun,Dio
They told him that he was blind,Dio
He didn't understand,Dio
'Cause he could see them inside,Dio
"They were twisted, oh",Dio
So Twisted,Dio
You could feel it they were,Dio
Twisted,Dio
Twisted up inside,Dio
Look inside any window,Dio
Come on and see the show,Dio
It's the same generation,Dio
They set you free,Dio
But they just won't let you go - no,Dio
It was a matter of time,Dio
They told me I was guilty,Dio
So I thought I did the crime,Dio
I never learned how to cry,Dio
And when I told the truth,Dio
They were sure it was a lie,Dio
Sure that I would cry,Dio
Sure of it,Dio
Sure of it 'cause I'm so,Dio
Twisted,Dio
She's twisted up inside,Dio
They're twisted,Dio
We're twisted,Dio
And when you're twisted,Dio
There's just no place to hide away,Dio
He was ready to rock and roll,Dio
So ready to lose control,Dio
But when a hungry heart,Dio
Gets a taste of freedom - you better look out,Dio
He was ready to push and shove,Dio
Ready to fight for love,Dio
But I've seen it before,Dio
And it can make you crazy,Dio
The eyes are what you see,Dio
Why are they watching me,Dio
She was ready to black and white,Dio
The colors were just too bright,Dio
She loved to fly,Dio
But she hated falling,Dio
She was caught in the in-between,Dio
Her dirty would not come clean,Dio
She ran for light,Dio
But she just got darkness,Dio
Just when you think you're free,Dio
The eyes are what you see,Dio
Why are they watching me,Dio
Why do they do the things they do,Dio
Why are they watching me,Dio
Watching you,Dio
If only the eyes could see,Dio
Then you'd know your destiny,Dio
The mind is an enemy,Dio
And you just need a friend,Dio
Are you ready for rock and roll,Dio
Ready to take control,Dio
If you see the eyes,Dio
Will it make you crazy - crazy,Dio
Crazy,Dio
My eyes can see inside tomorrow,Dio
My eyes can get next to you,Dio
Time flies on wings that just get stronger,Dio
My eyes are true,Dio
My eyes could see the body shakin',Dio
My eyes were clear and bright,Dio
Goodbyes are easy to remember,Dio
You can see the hurt still there in my eyes,Dio
I've fallen off the edge of the world,Dio
I've fallen from the top of the mountain,Dio
Just to rise again,Dio
I've seen it from heaven and hell,Dio
I've seen it from the eyes of a stargazer,Dio
I want to be invisible,Dio
Just get me out of here,Dio
"Could the dreamer be turning to stone, oh",Dio
Rock and roll eyes,Dio
The color of rainbows - believer of lies,Dio
"Rock and roll eyes, yeah",Dio
Don't want to see the end of it all,Dio
Just get me outta here,Dio
Just get me outta here,Dio
Just get me outta here,Dio
Rock and roll eyes,Dio
The keeper of rainbows,Dio
Collector of lies,Dio
Rock and roll eyes,Dio
My eyes,Dio
Rock and roll eyes,Dio
Tell rock and roll lies,Dio
And rock and roll lies,Dio
Never end,Dio
Rock and roll friends,Dio
With rock and roll trends,Dio
And rock and roll ends,Dio
With my eyes,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
You've been down too long in the midnight sea,Dio
Oh what's becoming of me,Dio
Ride the tiger,Dio
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean,Dio
Oh don't you see what I mean,Dio
Gotta get away,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
Shiny diamonds,Dio
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue,Dio
Something is coming for you,Dio
Race for the morning,Dio
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light,Dio
Oh we will pray it's all right,Dio
Gotta get away-get away,Dio
Between the velvet lies,Dio
There's a truth that's hard as steel,Dio
The vision never dies,Dio
Life's a never ending wheel,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
You're the star of the masquerade,Dio
No need to look so afraid,Dio
Jump on the tiger,Dio
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean,Dio
Some light can never be seen,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
You've been down too long in the midnight sea,Dio
Oh what's becoming of me,Dio
Ride the tiger,Dio
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean,Dio
Oh don't you see what I mean,Dio
Gotta get away,Dio
Holy Diver,Dio
When there's lightning - it always bring me down,Dio
Cause it's free and I see that it's me,Dio
Who's lost and never found,Dio
I cry for magic - I feel it dancing in the light,Dio
But it was cold - I lost my hold,Dio
To the shadows of the night,Dio
There's no sign of the morning coming,Dio
You've been left on your own,Dio
Like a Rainbow in the Dark,Dio
Do your demons - do they ever let you go,Dio
When you've tried - do they hide -deep inside,Dio
Is it someone that you know,Dio
You're a picture - just an image caught in time,Dio
We're a lie - you and I,Dio
We're words without a rhyme,Dio
There's no sign of the morning coming,Dio
You've been left on your own,Dio
Like a Rainbow in the Dark,Dio
When there's lightning - it always brings me down,Dio
Cause it's free and I see that it's me,Dio
Who's lost and never found,Dio
Feel the magic -feel it dancing in the air,Dio
But it's fear - and you'll hear,Dio
It calling you beware,Dio
There's no sign of the morning coming,Dio
There's no sight of the day,Dio
You've been left on your own,Dio
Like a Rainbow in the Dark,Dio
Don't talk to strangers,Dio
Mmmmh,Dio
Don't talk to strangers,Dio
'Cause they're only there to do you harm,Dio
Don't write in starlight,Dio
'Cause the words may come out real,Dio
Don't hide in doorways,Dio
You may find the key that opens up your soul,Dio
Don't go to heaven,Dio
'Cause it's really only hell,Dio
Don't smell the flowers,Dio
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind,Dio
Don't dream of women,Dio
'Cause they only bring you down,Dio
"Hey you, you know me, you've touched me, I'm real",Dio
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see and,Dio
Feel me,Dio
I'm danger - I'm the stranger,Dio
"And I, I'm darkness, I'm anger, I'm pain",Dio
I am master,Dio
The evil song you sing inside your brain,Dio
Drive you insane,Dio
Don't talk,Dio
"Don't let them inside your mind, yeah",Dio
"Run away, run away, go!",Dio
No - no,Dio
Don't let them in your mind,Dio
Protect your soul,Dio
Don't dance in darkness,Dio
You may stumble and you're sure to fall,Dio
Don't write in starlight,Dio
'Cause the words may come out real,Dio
Don't talk to strangers,Dio
'Cause they're only there to make you sad,Dio
Don't dream of women,Dio
'Cause they'll only bring you down,Dio
Yeah,Dio
"Run, run, run, run away!",Dio
You watch their faces,Dio
You'll see the traces,Dio
Of the things they want to be,Dio
But only we can see,Dio
They come for killing,Dio
They leave and still it seems,Dio
The cloud that's left behind,Dio
"Oh, can penetrate your mind",Dio
"But sail on, sing a song, carry on",Dio
"Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock",Dio
We pray to someone,Dio
But when it's said and done,Dio
It's really all the same,Dio
With just a different name,Dio
So many voices,Dio
All giving choices,Dio
If we listen they will say,Dio
"Oh, we can find the way",Dio
"But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on",Dio
"Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock",Dio
"We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock",Dio
We Rock!,Dio
We Rock,Dio
You watch their faces,Dio
You'll see the traces,Dio
Of the things they want to be,Dio
But only we can see,Dio
They come for killing,Dio
They leave and still it seems,Dio
The cloud that's left behind,Dio
Can penetrate your mind,Dio
"Sail on, sing a song, carry on",Dio
"Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock",Dio
"We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock",Dio
Ride out - stand and shout - carry on,Dio
Sail on - Sing your song - carry on,Dio
"Cause We Rock, We Rock, see how We Rock",Dio
We Rock,Dio
That's rock,Dio
We Rock,Dio
We Rock,Dio
We're a ship without a storm,Dio
The cold without the warm,Dio
"Light inside the darkness that it needs, yeah",Dio
We're a laugh without a tear,Dio
The hope without the fear,Dio
We are coming - home,Dio
We're off to the witch,Dio
We may never never never come home,Dio
But the magic that we'll feel,Dio
Is worth a lifetime,Dio
We're all born upon the cross,Dio
The throw before the toss,Dio
You can release yourself,Dio
But the only way is down,Dio
We don't come alone,Dio
We are fire we are stone,Dio
We're the hand that writes,Dio
Then quickly moves away,Dio
We'll know for the first time,Dio
If we're evil or divine,Dio
We're the last in line,Dio
We're the last in line,Dio
Two eyes from the east,Dio
It's the angel or the beast,Dio
And the answer lies between,Dio
The good and bad,Dio
We search for the truth,Dio
We could die upon the tooth,Dio
But the thrill of just the chase,Dio
Is worth the pain,Dio
We'll know for the first time,Dio
If we're evil or divine,Dio
We're the last in line,Dio
We're the last in line,Dio
We're off to the witch,Dio
We may never never never come home,Dio
But the magic that we'll feel,Dio
Is worth a lifetime,Dio
We're all born upon the cross,Dio
We're the throw before the toss,Dio
You know you can release yourself,Dio
But the only way you go is down,Dio
We'll know for the first time,Dio
If we're evil or divine,Dio
We're the last in line,Dio
We're the last in line,Dio
Hide in the midnight,Dio
"Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway",Dio
"Sail into never, they'll follow wherever you can go",Dio
And take you to the places you don't know,Dio
It's the call of the city,Dio
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart,Dio
It's places of pleasure,Dio
They promise you treasure if you fly,Dio
And then there goes the soul of you and I,Dio
Oh do you ever think about,Dio
The way I caught the rainbow,Dio
I'll be there where fire makes you dance,Dio
I'm gonna give you the look,Dio
That opens up the skies,Dio
I've got Evil Eyes...,Dio
Hide in the night-time,Dio
"Turn out the light, they'll see you anyway",Dio
"Sail into never, they'll follow wherever you can go",Dio
I've got Evil Eyes...,Dio
It was starting to rain,Dio
On the night that they first decided,Dio
It was blinding with snow,Dio
On the night that they ran away,Dio
They were found in the dark,Dio
But they never returned,Dio
Just like somebody slammed the door,Dio
She was meant to be wild,Dio
He was nearly a child,Dio
But they only could feel each other,Dio
They were paper and fire,Dio
Angel and liar,Dio
The devil of one another,Dio
Then they were thrown to the ground,Dio
With a terrible sound,Dio
Just like somebody broke a heart,Dio
Rock 'N' Roll Children,Dio
Alone again,Dio
Rock 'N' Roll Children,Dio
Without a friend,Dio
But they got Rock 'N' Roll,Dio
It was starting to rain,Dio
On the night that they cried forever,Dio
it was blinding with snow,Dio
On the night that they screamed goodbye,Dio
They were lost in the dark,Dio
And they never returned,Dio
Just like somebody slammed the door,Dio
On Rock 'N' Roll Children,Dio
Alone again,Dio
Rock 'N' Roll Children,Dio
Without a friend,Dio
The old ones speak of winter,Dio
The young ones praise the sun,Dio
And time just slips away,Dio
Running into nowhere,Dio
Turning like a wheel,Dio
And a year becomes a day,Dio
Whenever we dream,Dio
That's when we fly,Dio
So here is a dream,Dio
For just you and I,Dio
We'll fin the Sacred Heart,Dio
Somewhere bleeding in the night,Dio
Look for the light,Dio
And find the Sacred Heart,Dio
Here we see the wizard,Dio
Staring through the glass,Dio
And he's pointing right at you,Dio
You can see tomorrow,Dio
The answer and the lie,Dio
And the things you've got to do,Dio
"Oh, sometimes you never fall",Dio
And ah - You're the lucky one,Dio
But oh - Sometimes you want it all,Dio
You've got to reach for the sun,Dio
And find the Sacred Heart,Dio
Somewhere bleeding in the night,Dio
Oh look to the light,Dio
You fight to kill the dragon,Dio
And bargain with the beast,Dio
And sail into a sight,Dio
You run along the rainbow,Dio
And never leave the ground,Dio
And still you don't know why,Dio
Whenever you dream,Dio
You're holding the key,Dio
It opens the door,Dio
To let you be free,Dio
And find the Sacred Heart,Dio
Somewhere bleeding in the night,Dio
Run for the light,Dio
And you'll find the Sacred Heart,Dio
A shout comes from the wizard,Dio
The sky begins to crack,Dio
And he's looking right at you - Quick,Dio
Run along the rainbow,Dio
Before it turns to black - Attack,Dio
You're a dancer,Dio
But you're dancing on air,Dio
Just a matter of time till you fall,Dio
You're a dreamer,Dio
One night at the fair,Dio
But still you want it all,Dio
You're in danger,Dio
The last of a line,Dio
But the vision lasts forever,Dio
So just hold on,Dio
You can make it happen for you,Dio
Reach for the stars and you will fly,Dio
You're Hungry for Heaven,Dio
Hungry for Heaven,Dio
Hungry for Heaven,Dio
But you need a little hell,Dio
You're a runner,Dio
But you're chasing yourself,Dio
Feel the hot breath on your shoulder,Dio
You're emotion,Dio
Running cold running warm,Dio
The young just getting older,Dio
We are sunlight,Dio
We can sparkle and shine,Dio
And our dreams are what we're made of,Dio
So just hold on,Dio
You can make it happen for you,Dio
Reach for the stars and you will fly,Dio
You're Hungry for Heaven,Dio
Hungry for Heaven,Dio
Hungry for Heaven,Dio
But you need a little hell,Dio
Yes!,Dio
The best steel goes through the fire,Dio
And you seem to burn,Dio
The dead man's always a liar,Dio
Look out! There's another one learning!,Dio
Too late for tomorrow,Dio
There's only today,Dio
So take your magic carpet ride,Dio
Ooh,Dio
Hide in the rainbow,Dio
Hide in the rainbow,Dio
Ooh,Dio
The last one out of thunder,Dio
He will always survive,Dio
But if you are starting to wonder,Dio
"No no, you can never surrender",Dio
You see through the mystery,Dio
And now you can fly,Dio
So take your magic carpet ride,Dio
Ooh,Dio
Hide in the rainbow,Dio
Ooh - to hide - yeah,Dio
Hide in the rainbow,Dio
You hide in the rainbow,Dio
Ride to the sun - yeah!,Dio
Now the best steel goes through the fire,Dio
And you seem to burn,Dio
The dead man's always a liar,Dio
Look out! there's another one learning!,Dio
Ooh - ooh,Dio
You got to hide in the rainbow,Dio
Oooh - oooh - oooh,Dio
Hide in the rainbow,Dio
All's well at the midnight hour,Dio
You're ready to fly,Dio
Don't think about the darkness,Dio
Or the rumbling in the sky,Dio
Somewhere on the morning road,Dio
Just waiting for you,Dio
Somethings that just could never be,Dio
"Are calling up a spell so you can see, yeah!",Dio

So many shadows,Dio
Unholy light,Dio
Putting out the spark,Dio
Leave 'em in the dark - forever,Dio

Forever,Dio
Lately when my demons drag the night across my eyes,Dio
I just can't seem to fight it anymore,Dio
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world,Dio
But it seems that I have heard that song before,Dio
And the voices begin to sing - Come home,Dio
I have seen some evil as I've walked upon the earth,Dio
But this is way beyond what eyes can see,Dio
Wicked is as wicked does and if I lose control,Dio
Is this the way that hell is gonna be,Dio
Have I fallen too far to rise,Dio
Been burning too long in the fire,Dio
Then it all falls down - Tearing the night away,Dio
It must be - Fever dreams,Dio
Fever dreams,Dio
Fever dreams,Dio
Now before my demons roll the night across my eyes,Dio
I tremble as I wait perhaps to sin,Dio
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world,Dio
And all I do is let the beast come in,Dio
Have I fallen too far to rise,Dio
I've been standing too long in the fire,Dio
Let it all fall down,Dio
Tearing the night away,Dio
It must be - Fever dreams,Dio
From the outside - Fever dreams,Dio
"Oh, fever dreams",Dio
Fever dreams,Dio
Ooh-ooh,Dio
Fever dreams,Dio
Fever dreams,Dio
Fever dreams,Dio
Fever dreams,Dio
Fever dreams,Dio
Fever dreams,Dio

Giving up your spirit to the night,Dio
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone,Dio
Just for ever,Dio

Words have control,Dio
To take away your heart and then your soul,Dio
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone,Dio
Just for ever,Dio
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone,Dio
Oh pray for a miracle,Dio
But the wishes in the well have all gone dry,Dio
There's no way for a miracle,Dio
"It's not the way you live, it's how you'll die",Dio
Welcome to sun down - Welcome to the dark,Dio
Could it be that the evil has heroes,Dio
We've turned it all around - Celebration,Dio
Words have control,Dio
To take away your heart and then your soul,Dio
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone,Dio
Just for ever,Dio
You'll turn to stone,Dio
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone,Dio
Concerning the inhabitants of Otherworld.,Dio
"There are many similarities to be found, parallel to our own society.",Dio
The individual must be absorbed. The collective must be as one. Feed my head!,Dio
Hiding in a corner,Dio
Waiting for the storm,Dio
Maybe they'll forget about me,Dio
Avoid connection,Dio
Still they say you always surrender,Dio
All the smiling faces,Dio
Promising the sun,Dio
Another way of breaking you down,Dio
All is lost,Dio
Hope is dead,Dio
Feed my mind,Dio
Fill my head,Dio
Hope is gone,Dio
The spell's been said,Dio
Fill my mind,Dio
Feed my head,Dio
Ah,Dio
Waiting for my number,Dio
To climb upon the cross,Dio
Maybe they'll forget about me,Dio
Must avoid detection,Dio
But they say you'll still go down,Dio
Safe in dreams,Dio
Away from where they are,Dio
Let me be nowhere,Dio
Just another star,Dio
Safe in night,Dio
The shadows cloak their eyes,Dio
Take me to nowhere,Dio
Where everybody flies,Dio
Oh!,Dio
All is lost,Dio
Hope is dead,Dio
Feed my mind,Dio
Fill my head,Dio
Hope is gone,Dio
The spell's been said,Dio
Fill my mind,Dio
Feed my head,Dio
All is lost,Dio
Hope is dead,Dio
Feed my mind,Dio
Fill my head,Dio
Hope is gone,Dio
The spell's been said,Dio
Fill my mind,Dio
Feed my head,Dio
All is lost,Dio
Hope is dead,Dio
Feed my mind,Dio
Fill my head,Dio
Hope is gone,Dio
The spell's been said,Dio
Fill my mind,Dio
Feed my head,Dio
All is lost,Dio
Hope is dead,Dio
Feed my mind,Dio
Fill my head,Dio
Now that my dreams have gone dead,Dio
I see them burning in the fire,Dio
Just like the words that I've said,Dio
Ashes turned to ashes once again,Dio
Look for a sign in the air,Dio
A light that dances in the sky,Dio
Maybe you'll see it somewhere,Dio
"Oh, shining like a diamond",Dio
Promising that hope will never die,Dio
I might know the answer,Dio
"Well, it's back there in my brain",Dio
Someday soon I'll be rising again,Dio
Higher than the sun,Dio
I have been father and son,Dio
I cry for children of the night,Dio
Just because tears have begun,Dio
Beware of quiet voices,Dio
Thunder comes from silence - I am light,Dio
"Oh, look for a sign, is it me",Dio
No don't believe with only eyes,Dio
Speak to the blind 'cause they see,Dio
Truth is just a circle,Dio
Spinning round until it meets the lies,Dio
Then dies,Dio
I am a rock,Dio
And you are glass,Dio
Never broken - never last,Dio
And if you're in my way I'll knock you down,Dio
If it's a joke,Dio
I'll never laugh,Dio
Here's exactly how I see you in the light,Dio
You're like a tear in the ocean,Dio
Dust in the wind,Dio
Like a stone in the water,Dio
I'm gonna sleep with the devil's daughter,Dio
I am your shock,Dio
I am your shame,Dio
Another face without a name,Dio
And if you think I'm angry just come over,Dio
I need to tell,Dio
Just who you are,Dio
My description of the world I've seen so far,Dio
You're like a tear in the ocean,Dio
Dust in the wind,Dio
Like a stone in the water,Dio
I might marry the devil's daughter,Dio
I am a rock,Dio
And you are glass,Dio
If it's a joke,Dio
Nobody laugh,Dio
And even - When you know you're guilty still you're right,Dio
You're like a tear in the ocean,Dio
Dust in the wind,Dio
Like a stone in the water,Dio
Like a spark in the fire,Dio
Dust in the sand,Dio
Like a stone in the water,Dio
I'm gonna run with the devil's daughter,Dio
"Run, run, run, run, run away!",Dio
"Require, explanation. What is love? ",Dio
Who is love? When is love? Where is love? Why is love?,Dio
From the first time we touched with our eyes,Dio
Only magic could take away my heart,Dio
I am always afraid for my heart,Dio
So lay beside me now and tell me lies - sweet lies,Dio
As long as it's not about love,Dio
Shall we sail off the edge of the world,Dio
Fall forever and never look behind,Dio
But I must keep my heart from my mind,Dio
Lay beside me now and tell me lies,Dio
As long as it's not about love,Dio
Oh the last time we touched with our eyes,Dio
And the magic was stronger than the heart,Dio
"Oh, I can't run away with my heart",Dio
"So, lay beside me now and tell me lies",Dio
As long as it's not about love,Dio
Shall we sail off the edge of the world,Dio
Fall forever,Dio
Take my heart away but no,Dio
You can't say words about love,Dio
Ooh,Dio
If the magic comes between us,Dio
And we never meet again,Dio
Take a part of me away,Dio
'Cause maybe it's all above love,Dio
"Love, ooh",Dio
Someone said,Dio
You'll light up the universe,Dio
It's there in your head then,Dio
Crazy comes to call,Dio
Break me down,Dio
I'm only an everyone,Dio
Running from free,Dio
Running from me,Dio
And though it's not of my choosing,Dio
I'm losing my insanity,Dio
Again,Dio
Someone said,Dio
Forever was yesterday,Dio
So open your head when,Dio
Crazy comes around,Dio
Break me down,Dio
I'm only an innocent,Dio
Howl at the moon,Dio
Knowing that soon,Dio
And though it's always confusing,Dio
I'm losing my insanity,Dio
Round and round,Dio
Like the wheels in my mind,Dio
Round and round and down and down and down,Dio
And down and down,Dio
Someone said,Dio
Believe in your otherside,Dio
It's there in your head and,Dio
Waiting for a ride,Dio
Break me down,Dio
Ah once I was everything,Dio
Breaking the law,Dio
Quick on the draw,Dio
And though it's not of my choosing,Dio
I'm losing my insanity,Dio
Again,Dio
Turn round slowly,Dio
Tell us what you see,Dio
Oh no - The fly got the spider,Dio
And now he's chasing me,Dio
Change comes slowly,Dio
But this is what you'll be,Dio
Somehow it snows in the summer,Dio
"And the sun is freezing me, oh",Dio
Pain comes easy,Dio
If pleasure will let go,Dio
Oh oh - I still remember,Dio
And this is how I know,Dio
Rain falls slowly,Dio
Here it cuts you down,Dio
Oh no - We're all one another,Dio
Oh no - I'm caught in an otherworld,Dio
Rainbows and blue skies,Dio
Are black and white,Dio
Killed in their sleep by the queen,Dio
We have forsaken,Dio
Beginnings and taken the end - Amen,Dio
We've been forsaken,Dio
Beginnings and given the end - Amen,Dio
Time moves slowly,Dio
But here it never ends,Dio
Oh oh - We're all one another,Dio
Oh no - I'm caught in an otherworld,Dio
And the games still go on,Dio
With a warning to the bishop from the pawn,Dio
No one sees an angel till it smashes to the ground,Dio
And then you run somewhere,Dio
And leave it lying there,Dio
Then on we sail,Dio
Never thinking that the wind could ever fail,Dio
No one gets to heaven till they've lived awhile in hell,Dio
And even then it's rare,Dio
That you'll be going there,Dio
Now we understand. All traces of Magica must be eliminated. ,Dio
"Infection. Infection. Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete,",Dio
delete delete delete delete...,Dio
I love the night,Dio
So many shadows,Dio
Unholy night,Dio
Secrets of the heart,Dio
Leave 'em in the dark,Dio
Forever,Dio
Silence - we hunt for the queen,Dio
Sign of the cross,Dio
And pray in-between,Dio
Look by the light of the day,Dio
She's hiding till dark,Dio
Waiting to play hey-hey,Dio
Something's taken a child,Dio
And it all must end,Dio
Time to be killing the dragon again,Dio
Silence - we'll hunt for the lord,Dio
He takes crimson and gold,Dio
Gave ice to the cold,Dio
Oh to be never afraid,Dio
Of wolves at the door,Dio
Howling for more,Dio
More's been empty for years,Dio
And it all must end,Dio
Time to be killing the dragon again,Dio
Kneel and behold your new king,Dio
Digital dreams,Dio
And wonderful things to tease you,Dio
Small gods with electrical hearts,Dio
And it all will end,Dio
Time to be killing the dragon,Dio
Remember when you only needed no one,Dio
Every day's tomorrow,Dio
And it's all right,Dio
No confessions - not for you,Dio
Forget the things you've done,Dio
It's what you'll do,Dio
The first time you're suspicious,Dio
What's that gliding down,Dio
Along comes a spider,Dio
Suddenly the world has no more changes,Dio
You've run with an evil woman,Dio
So it's all right,Dio
No more strangers' candy lies,Dio
The light is so much better for your eyes,Dio
Now I'm not superstitious,Dio
But every time you've tried,Dio
Along comes a spider,Dio
Don't ask why - it's the long way around,Dio
Just go wild,Dio
Why do we believe in conversation,Dio
We never seem to listen,Dio
We only hear,Dio
Now you don't need permission,Dio
But don't get caught next time,Dio
Along comes a spider,Dio
A spider,Dio
A spider,Dio
Inside her,Dio
You've made it through another day,Dio
Driving past the backroads of your mind,Dio
You could have turned the other way,Dio
And break down on the sanity you've found inside you,Dio
Someone said that you are fantasy,Dio
But in the darkness,Dio
Behind your smile,Dio
You scream,Dio
Scream,Dio
Scream for the crazy ones,Dio
Scream at the things you've done,Dio
Scream at the rising sun,Dio
We bless the beautiful,Dio
Let us forgive you for your sins,Dio
These must be holy ones,Dio
How could we believe they'd let us in,Dio
"Oh, once I heard that they were fantasy",Dio
But in the darkness,Dio
Behind their smiles,Dio
They scream,Dio
Scream,Dio
Scream of a broken heart,Dio
Scream as they come apart,Dio
Scream cause they never started,Dio
Scream,Dio
No pain,Dio
No sympathy,Dio
You've always been so steady at the wheel,Dio
Some friend reality,Dio
You break down on the highway,Dio
About to see it my way,Dio
Scream at the crazy ones,Dio
Scream cause they all have sons,Dio
Scream as they point the gun at you,Dio
Scream at the bleeding heart,Dio
Scream cause the end won't start,Dio
Scream as you come apart again,Dio
"Again, again, again...",Dio
I'm all right - I'm crossing over,Dio
I just shot the sun,Dio
One more night - black as heaven,Dio
So no-one saw the gun,Dio
Running with monsters in shadows,Dio
And monsters always know,Dio
It's better in the dark,Dio
"Oh, she's all right - tall and handsome",Dio
If the lights are down,Dio
Gone by dawn - takes no chances,Dio
Might come back around,Dio
Clutching to monsters in shadows,Dio
And monsters always know,Dio
It's better in the dark,Dio
I'm all right - I'm crossing over,Dio
I can disappear - gone,Dio
Clutching to monsters in shadows,Dio
And monsters always know,Dio
It's better in the dark,Dio
Better in the dark,Dio
I just shot the sun,Dio
If they take away your song,Dio
You can finally hear the voices,Dio
Of the ones that don't belong,Dio
In the face of the rising wind,Dio
We all sing Gloria,Dio
Is there flame without fire,Dio
Most unlikely,Dio
If you're there when the walls come down,Dio
We all sing - warrior,Dio
Is there sight without sound,Dio
Most unlikely,Dio
But we got rock and roll,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Take me anywhere,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Is there someone there,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
On the edge of the last goodbye,Dio
We all sing - warrior,Dio
Ah the brave never die,Dio
Most unlikely,Dio
"Hey, send your heroes of to war",Dio
But whisper in their ear,Dio
Never cross the song police,Dio
They can tell you what you're gonna hear - again,Dio
For the sake of the left behind,Dio
We all sing Gloria,Dio
Soon forgotten by time,Dio
So unlikely,Dio
Cause we got rock and roll,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Take you anywhere,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Someone's always there,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Bring me anywhere,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Someone's always there,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
"Rock and roll me, ah",Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
Rock and roll,Dio
You've ridden on a carousel,Dio
So you know the feeling,Dio
As the ring slips through your fingers,Dio
Sometimes you justify it,Dio
But there's the sword,Dio
And you're bleeding once again,Dio
Before you're in a corner,Dio
Can't crawl away,Dio
Here's a way to save you,Dio
You gotta push,Dio
Get out of my way and push,Dio
You can turn the wheel,Dio
Push,Dio
One more push,Dio
You're master of the broken heart,Dio
And so you know the feeling,Dio
As your soul starts going under,Dio
Sometimes you rectify it,Dio
Then out of the blue,Dio
The hammer falls again,Dio
Before you're in the water,Dio
Can't sail away,Dio
Here's a way to save you,Dio
You gotta push,Dio
Break the body down,Dio
Oh push,Dio
Out of my way I'll push,Dio
You better push,Dio
You gotta push,Dio
Hands against the wall,Dio
And push,Dio
Out of my way we'll push,Dio
You can turn the wheel,Dio
Go on and push,Dio
Push,Dio
Push,Dio
Push,Dio
Push,Dio
He'd never tell her lies,Dio
And she believed in magic,Dio
But when the magic died,Dio
She could see that all along he's just been,Dio
"Guilty - a liar, liar",Dio
Guilty,Dio
Guilty - burn in fire,Dio
Guilty,Dio
It's time to say goodbye,Dio
Don't tell another story,Dio
Another alibi,Dio
Now you see that all along he's just been,Dio
"Guilty - a liar, liar",Dio
Guilty,Dio
Guilty - you burn in fire,Dio
Guilty,Dio
Guilty - the great pretender,Dio
Guilty,Dio
You're guilty - just surrender cause you're guilty,Dio
Broken promise,Dio
But please forgive again,Dio
One more time for me,Dio
It's the very last time - you'll see,Dio
"Guilty - liar, liar",Dio
You'll burn in fire,Dio
"Guilty - liar, liar",Dio
Guilty,Dio
Guilty - the great pretender,Dio
Guilty,Dio
"Guilty - just surrender, you're guilty",Dio
"Guilty, guilty, guilty",Dio
"A liar, liar",Dio
Guilty - you'll burn in fire,Dio
"Oh guilty, you'll burn in fire",Dio
Surrender - guilty,Dio
So guilty,Dio
"Oh-oh, the sun's gone down",Dio
Her day begins,Dio
And the rhythm of the darkness,Dio
Wakes the dead,Dio
Don't answer eyes that smile,Dio
Don't let them in,Dio
They see the lonely child,Dio
She feels their sin,Dio
But it's getting so much colder,Dio
And she's afraid,Dio
Never going back to where the pain was,Dio
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now,Dio
Someone's thrown away their children,Dio
You can see them running from your smile,Dio
Sing for the runaway children,Dio
The throw-away child,Dio
I'll make you safe and warm,Dio
Words she needs to hear,Dio
What they really mean is no more little girl,Dio
Don't see her anymore,Dio
They disappear,Dio
Yesterday they said that she was dying,Dio
And just today I heard that she was dead,Dio
Someone's thrown away their children,Dio
You can see them running from your smile,Dio
Sing for the runaway children,Dio
The throw-away child,Dio
Someone's thrown away their children,Dio
You can hear them only if you try,Dio
Sing for the runaway children,Dio
Goodbye,Dio
Someone's thrown away their children,Dio
You can see them running from your smile,Dio
Sing for the runaway children,Dio
The throw-away child,Dio
Someone had a dream,Dio
Never been to London,Dio
Never in a limousine,Dio
Something made him go,Dio
Could it be the voices,Dio
Coming from the radio,Dio
But somewhere down the line,Dio
The happiness you'll find,Dio
Will crash into a wall,Dio
Just before the fall,Dio
Someone joined the band,Dio
But he never heard the music,Dio
Couldn't really understand,Dio
"No, no no",Dio
Don't know what they mean,Dio
Where's my picture,Dio
Shining from a magazine,Dio
But somewhere down the line,Dio
He'll quickly glance behind,Dio
Then smash into a wall,Dio
Before the fall,Dio
Someone ran so fast,Dio
When he saw the future,Dio
He was sure that it was just the past,Dio
Someone had a dream,Dio
Only this one ended lost,Dio
Inside the old machine,Dio
And somewhere down the line,Dio
They'll say that his is mine,Dio
And all that's left is time,Dio
"Time to fall and stumble, ah",Dio
Tired of living in the black and white?,Dio
Where fools can tell you that you're never right,Dio
I know a place where the film's in color,Dio
Just step inside of yourself,Dio
Here's a place in the front row,Dio
So on with the show,Dio
The same old shadow on the run,Dio
"That's no shadow, it's your shadow's son",Dio
I know a place where the pools got water,Dio
And you don't need to know how to swim,Dio
Here's the key to the back door,Dio
Do you want more,Dio
Do you need more?,Dio
Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme,Dio
The same old clock - same old time,Dio
There's a place where the grass is greener,Dio
"And you can shake, rattle and roll",Dio
Here's the key to the front door,Dio
Do you want more,Dio
Will you need more?,Dio
Tired of living in the black and white,Dio
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right,Dio
Same old steps to the same old dance,Dio
Just one more reason - one more chance,Dio
Oh,Dio
Every time that I look into the mirror,Dio
All these lines in my face getting clearer,Dio
The past is gone,Dio
It went by like dusk to dawn,Dio
Isn't that the way,Dio
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay,Dio
"Well, I know, nobody knows",Dio
Where it comes and where it goes,Dio
I know it's everybody's sin,Dio
You got lose to know how to win,Dio
Half my life's in books' written pages,Dio
Lived and learned from fools and from sages,Dio
"You know it's true, oh",Dio
All these things come back to you,Dio
"Sing with me, sing for the years",Dio
"Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears",Dio
"Sing with me, just for today",Dio
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take it away,Dio
Hey-hey-hey,Dio
"Sing with me, sing for the years",Dio
"Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears",Dio
"Sing with me, just for today",Dio
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take it away,Dio
"Dream on, dream on, dream on",Dio
Dream yourself a dream come true,Dio
"Dream on, dream on, dream on",Dio
Dream until your dream comes true,Dio
"Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on",Dio
"Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on, oh",Dio
"Sing with me, sing for the years",Dio
"Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears",Dio
"Sing with me, just for today",Dio
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take it away,Dio
"Sing with me, sing for the years",Dio
"Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears",Dio
"Sing with me, just for today",Dio
"Maybe tomorrow will pull out and take it away, yeah",Dio
Well I've never been here before,Dio
But I'm coming back tomorrow,Dio
For the real pain - a cold rain again,Dio
Nice day for a crucifixion,Dio
Heard a new prediction,Dio
That we can all be saved - so I'll have,Dio
One more for the road - play it again,Dio
One more for the road,Dio
Never heard this before,Dio
That a child can tell who's evil,Dio
But it's a good thing if we sing along,Dio
Cold day - we can make a fire,Dio
Burn another liar,Dio
Can witches ever die - hey let's burn,Dio
One more for the road - gimme the same again,Dio
One more for the road,Dio
Well I've never been here before,Dio
And the room is really empty,Dio
But there's a big line waiting for the show,Dio
Nice day for an execution,Dio
Another wrong conclusion,Dio
But someone's got to pay - so let's burn,Dio
One more for the road - same again,Dio
One more for the road,Dio
There's a child who just sees evil,Dio
And a man who just loves pain,Dio
But I've heard that we can't save them,Dio
So gimme me the same again,Dio
There's a cross that you can't carry,Dio
Cause it's heavier than hell,Dio
And if you should meet your maker,Dio
Just pray that he won't yell,Dio
One more for the road,Dio
One more for the road,Dio
One more for the road,Dio
One more for the road,Dio
And then you dream,Dio
Of a world with only windows,Dio
Inside you - you can hide you,Dio
You know,Dio
And then the night,Dio
You're just another empty shadow,Dio
No questions - no answers,Dio
No one to scream at you,Dio
Turn around and when you face the sun,Dio
We can make you be like everyone you know,Dio
Hey you - you're just master of the moon,Dio
And then the eyes,Dio
If you look at them they'll blind you,Dio
Who are you - what are you,Dio
Why do you scream at me,Dio
Turn around and when you face the sun,Dio
We can make you be like everyone you know,Dio
Hey you - you're just master of the moon,Dio
We can shake you make you over,Dio
We just need some time to,Dio
Shed some light upon your darkness,Dio
We need your mind,Dio
And then you dream again,Dio
In a world that only you know,Dio
Inside you - you can hide you,Dio
No one to scream at you,Dio
Turn around and when you face the sun,Dio
We can make you be like everyone you know,Dio
I'll turn away and never face the sun,Dio
You never make me be like you,Dio
I'm master of the moon,Dio
If I could sleep at night,Dio
Then somehow I'd see,Dio
Why everything's wrong,Dio
Or maybe it's just me,Dio
Does anybody know this place that I'm in,Dio
Why I might be alone,Dio
Imagination is a terrible thing,Dio
What if I'm wrong,Dio
But here's what I've been thinking,Dio
It must be the end of the world,Dio
What ever happened to the rock and roll song,Dio
Breaking your brain,Dio
Making you stronger,Dio
They say you never hear the bullet that kills,Dio
And I don't hear a sound,Dio
It's not about a change or revolution,Dio
What's gone today is still called substitution,Dio
Don't get emotional but we're out of time,Dio
The melody's gone,Dio
And fools have got the sunshine,Dio
If I'm mistaken and I see you again,Dio
Don't leave me alone,Dio
Maybe tomorrow,Dio
Could be the end of the world,Dio
Don't make wishes,Dio
Don't waste time,Dio
Call the ones you hate,Dio
You'd say I'm sorry but they'll have to wait,Dio
Fot the end of the world,Dio
Bye bye bye bye bye bye,Dio
Fingers scratching blackboards,Dio
Make cowards of the brave,Dio
A natural reaction,Dio
From the cradle to the grave,Dio
Rats and bats and spiders,Dio
And little things that crawl,Dio
Never make me tremble,Dio
I'm bothered not at all,Dio
Then I saw you,Dio
Something new inside of me,Dio
What's this shakin',Dio
You made me shiver,Dio
Cemetery midnights,Dio
Walking on the dead,Dio
Never seemed to matter,Dio
It's all inside your head,Dio
Names are only letters,Dio
Mentioned on a stone,Dio
And If you're going somewhere,Dio
You're going it alone,Dio
Then I saw you,Dio
Something new inside of me,Dio
What's this shakin',Dio
You made me shiver,Dio
Magic charms and voodoo,Dio
And all those other spells,Dio
Didn't make impressions,Dio
I never slept so well,Dio
If I had a nightmare,Dio
I'm sure that I would know,Dio
I really don't remember,Dio
But I'm sure it isn't so,Dio
Then I saw you,Dio
Something new inside of me,Dio
What's this shakin',Dio
Turn out the lights it won't matter,Dio
A bucket of blood and I'm still fine,Dio
A black cat's only a color,Dio
But you can do it any time,Dio
Bless me father I must go away,Dio
To save us from the one's who don't believe,Dio
Confess me father I have sin but maybe,Dio
Angels really sing,Dio
Fot the man who would be king,Dio
We laugh at your religion,Dio
You people of the sand,Dio
We have no superstition,Dio
You can read it in our hands,Dio
Forgive me father for the change we bring,Dio
But it's all for the man who would be king,Dio
Don't leave a body standing,Dio
Not the holy not the small,Dio
Deliver us from evil,Dio
If it's yours we want it all,Dio
Lately father I've been wondering,Dio
Is the devil just the man who would be king,Dio
How can right be ever wrong,Dio
We are glory we are stronger than you,Dio
We never got an answer,Dio
But it's just too late to ask,Dio
The bloody flag was waving,Dio
And our hearts just ran too fast,Dio
Curse me father for the chains we bring,Dio
And don't believe the man who would be king,Dio
We never got an answer,Dio
Cause the question slipped my mind,Dio
I've been so busy killing,Dio
That I haven't found the right time,Dio
Oh no - they're at it again,Dio
Looking inside my secrets,Dio
Coming through cracks before I mend the wall,Dio
Get out - cause you're breaking the law,Dio
How did you ever find me,Dio
Places where I can hide can't get much smaller,Dio
I have invisible dreams,Dio
Where no one can touch me,Dio
Maybe I'll find a way to disappear,Dio
No one moves - and no one dies,Dio
Just the eyes,Dio
I've run as fast as I can,Dio
Thinking they'll never catch me,Dio
What a waste of breath a waste of time,Dio
Feel like digging a hole,Dio
Going in even deeper,Dio
Maybe they just can't see what just can't shine,Dio
I'll be lost - so no goddbyes,Dio
If no one moves then nothing dies,Dio
Just the eyes,Dio
Oh no - they've done it again,Dio
Sending out the detectives,Dio
Searching for signs of life and that means me,Dio
In my invisible dreams,Dio
When no one is watching,Dio
I'd make the whole world blind and I'd be free,Dio
I'll be lost - so no replies,Dio
If no one looks then no one dies,Dio
Just the eyes,Dio
Those eyes,Dio
Magic numbers,Dio
Even sacrifice,Dio
I can't find a way,Dio
Cause nothing stops the eyes,Dio
When a milion miles from no where,Dio
Is still too close to home,Dio
You're with a hundred thousand people,Dio
And you still feel all alone,Dio
She was never in the circle,Dio
Or the round would be a square,Dio
And the more she seemed to want it,Dio
The less they seemed to care,Dio
Sold out and no admission,Dio
Too late to buy,Dio
It's never who it's only why,Dio
She's living the lie,Dio
When you're on your way to somewhere,Dio
But the elevator falls,Dio
Do you look for stairs to heaven,Dio
Or wander through the halls,Dio
He was only dedicated,Dio
To the ones who make the law,Dio
But they burned with too much fire,Dio
And his heart was made of straw,Dio
No ticket - no admission,Dio
Too late to buy,Dio
It's always he and he knows why,Dio
He's living the lie,Dio
Break down,Dio
How bad do you want it,Dio
How far will you go,Dio
If you're looking at tomorrow,Dio
To forget about today,Dio
Then the past will be your future,Dio
And it's there you'll always stay,Dio
What about the pictures,Dio
That smile from magazines,Dio
The ultimate temptation,Dio
Our new kings and all our queens,Dio
Such heat and too much pressure,Dio
Not worth the try,Dio
No more for them,Dio
Now it's I,Dio
And no more living the lie,Dio
Living the lie,Dio
Oh why,Dio
Live the lie,Dio
I think I'm through with just pretending,Dio
Knocking at a door,Dio
That I've been through before,Dio
Congratulations - at last you've seen my light,Dio
Now it's you against the night,Dio
I think I'm never coming after - after all,Dio
Now I've become the cat,Dio
Who always lets you know that,Dio
I Am I Am - stronger than the wind,Dio
I Am I Am sin,Dio
I Am I Am - stronger without you,Dio
I Am,Dio
For all the words gone unspoken,Dio
Silence isn't gold,Dio
Or the story's never told,Dio
Investigation - at last I've found my light,Dio
And we shine,Dio
So now I'm like the cat,Dio
Who always tells you this that,Dio
I Am I Am - stronger than the wind,Dio
I Am I Am sin,Dio
I Am I Am better without you,Dio
I Am,Dio
I think I'm way outside illusion,Dio
Breaking down the door,Dio
That locked me in before,Dio
Congratulations - now that you've see my light - after all,Dio
And when I become the cat,Dio
I'll always let you know that,Dio
I Am I Am - stronger than the wind,Dio
I Am I Am sin,Dio
I Am I Am - stronger without you,Dio
I Am,Dio
I Am I Am - brighter than the sun,Dio
I Am I Am everyone,Dio
I Am I Am - better without you,Dio
I Am,Dio
I Am I Am - stronger than before,Dio
I Am I Am more,Dio
I Am I Am - ready to go on,Dio
I Am,Dio
One night when the stars were right,Dio
For the gypsy queen,Dio
And she found she could drog you down,Dio
To a place that's in - between it all she's a,Dio
Madman with a delicate hand and evil eyes,Dio
And I've heard she'll only say a word,Dio
And that's enough to satisfy,Dio
Don't ask why,Dio
Don't even think about it,Dio
Brave men die,Dio
But what a way to go,Dio
She's not above,Dio
Death by love,Dio
One spell from the wishing well,Dio
And you're nevermore,Dio
Bad start for the sacred heart,Dio
Cause the end has come before the beginning,Dio
Knee deep in the darkest sleep,Dio
But the eyes see all,Dio
So high you could break the sky,Dio
And never feel the fall to come,Dio
Strong men die,Dio
But what a way to go,Dio
She's not above,Dio
Death by love,Dio
Don't ask why,Dio
Don't even think about it,Dio
Brave men die,Dio
But what a way to go,Dio
You've got symptoms of,Dio
Death by love,Dio
She's not above,Dio
Death by love,Dio
Don't ask why,Dio
Don't even guess about it,Dio
All men die,Dio
But this is death by love,Dio
Help me - save me,Dio
I've just crossed the line,Dio
Where reason might betray me,Dio
Wake me - shake me,Dio
Send a message to my brain,Dio
Before they take me,Dio
How can I get through to you,Dio
That wishes just come true,Dio
In dreams,Dio
Don't go - don't dare,Dio
Cause the journey drives you made,Dio
Before you get there,Dio
Help me - save me,Dio
I'll be glad to give you back,Dio
The hand you gave me,Dio
How can I get through to you,Dio
That wishes do come true,Dio
In dreams,Dio
If I'm a river - then you're the sea,Dio
Somewhere you'll find me,Dio
Alone and swimming here in ecstasy,Dio
If I am silence - you must be scream,Dio
But I don't hear you,Dio
I'm in a place that I've just never seen before,Dio
Don't go - you'll never save me,Dio
I've just slapped away,Dio
That helping hand you gave me,Dio
Don't wake me - Don't shake me,Dio
Here's a message from my brain,Dio
You'll never take me,Dio
How can I get through to you,Dio
That wishes do come true in dreams,Dio
In my dreams,Dio
Bring me down drag me away from heaven,Dio
But look out angels guard the door,Dio
We all choose pain if pleasure is ordinary,Dio
Then we beg for more and more and more,Dio
Oh lock me up in an institution and throw away the key,Dio
Then I'm free the prisoner of paradise,Dio
Take me down I've gone too high so hurry how can this be real,Dio
I paid for the ride and got wishes for eternity,Dio
And here's one more I wish that you would steal them,Dio
Tie me down and don't believe me if I say I'm free,Dio
It's still me the prisoner of paradise,Dio
Bring me down if I could start all over would I do the same,Dio
Oh I'd try for a while then hunger for the recipe,Dio
And all I'd hear is isn't it a shame,Dio
Oh wrap me up in some chains,Dio
And you can push me out to sea,Dio
Cover me up with the ocean then I'm free,Dio
The prisoner of paradise,Dio
"And then the dark, the dark...",Dio
I've been way beyond your universe,Dio
And I've seen things that I should never tell,Dio
But here I go again I just can't keep it to myself,Dio
The story of my world and how I fell,Dio
Round and round,Dio
The square inside the circle,Dio
And still I shake the same,Dio
At the rhythm of her name,Dio
Electra,Dio
Electra,Dio
I believed in love and miracles,Dio
So how can I be blamed for what I've done?,Dio
And if it's still a sin to hide the best parts for yourself,Dio
Then I have sinned but only just begun,Dio
"There's no thunder, no lightning",Dio
Just a gentle breeze,Dio
To warn you that something,Dio
Will bring you to your knees,Dio
Round and round,Dio
You're caught inside the circle,Dio
Still I shake the same,Dio
At the mention of her name,Dio
Electra,Dio
Electra,Dio
"Hey, I've been way beyond your universe",Dio
And I've come back to introduce to you,Dio
"The fear of the heart, just try to keep it from yourself",Dio
And it will be the last thing that you'll do,Dio
Round and round,Dio
You're caught inside a circle,Dio
And you will shake the same,Dio
At the magic of her name,Dio
Electra,Dio
Electra,Dio
I am here to show my changes,Dio
"Not to change what I've become, no, no",Dio
I'm not alone and she will testify,Dio
"That it's the best thing that I've done, oh, oh, for",Dio
Electra,Dio
Electra,Dio

Hidden meanings that will never show,Ozzy
Fools and prophets from the past,Ozzy
Life's a stage and we're all in the cast,Ozzy

Asking me who to follow,Ozzy
Don't ask me,Ozzy

I don't know,Ozzy
I don't know,Ozzy
I don't know,Ozzy
Nobody ever told me,Ozzy
I found out for myself,Ozzy
You gotta believe in foolish miracles,Ozzy

I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train,Ozzy
"I've listened to preachers,",Ozzy
I've listened to fools,Ozzy
I've watched all the dropouts,Ozzy
Who make their own rules,Ozzy
One person conditioned to rule and control,Ozzy
The media sells it and you live the role,Ozzy
Mental wounds still screaming,Ozzy
Driving me insane,Ozzy
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train,Ozzy
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train,Ozzy

"You, looking at me, looking at you",Ozzy
I wanna talk to you,Ozzy
"You, looking at me, looking at you",Ozzy
Carry on from day to day,Ozzy

"Something in my vision, something deep inside",Ozzy
"Where did I wander, where d'ya think I wandered to",Ozzy
I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through,Ozzy
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now,Ozzy
I told them I had ridden shooting stars,Ozzy
And said I'd show them how,Ozzy
"Over and over, always tried to get away",Ozzy
"Living in a daydream, only place I had to stay",Ozzy
Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide,Ozzy

Here we go now,Ozzy
"Oh no, oh now",Ozzy
Here we go now,Ozzy
Got a crazy feeling I don't understand,Ozzy
'Gotta get away from here,Ozzy
Feelin' like I should have kept my feet on the ground,Ozzy
Waitin' for the sun to appear,Ozzy
Mamma's gonna worry,Ozzy
"I've been a bad, bad boy",Ozzy
No use sayin' sorry,Ozzy
It's something that I enjoy,Ozzy
'Cause you can't see what my eyes see,Ozzy
"(I can see it, I can see it)",Ozzy
And you can't be inside of me,Ozzy
Flying high again,Ozzy
"I can see trough mountains, watch me disappear",Ozzy
I can even touch the sky,Ozzy
Swallowing colours of the sound I hear,Ozzy
Am I just a crazy guy (you bet),Ozzy
Mamma's gonna worry,Ozzy
"I've been a bad, bad boy",Ozzy
No use sayin' sorry,Ozzy
It's something that I enjoy,Ozzy

How many times,Ozzy
Can they fill me with lies,Ozzy
And I listen again,Ozzy
Twisting the truth,Ozzy
"And they're playin' around with my head, O.K.",Ozzy
The things they will do and the things they will say,Ozzy
But they don't really understand,Ozzy
Tears fill my eyes when I hear all the cries,Ozzy
For the reason today,Ozzy
And they don't really know even what they're talkin' about,Ozzy
And I can't image what empty heads can achieve,Ozzy
"Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more",Ozzy
'Cos rock & roll is my religion and my law,Ozzy
"Won't ever change, may think it's strange",Ozzy
"You can't kill rock & roll, it's here to stay",Ozzy
Lookin' through eyes of time,Ozzy
Mirrors reflecting their stories untrue,Ozzy
"Promises, promises",Ozzy
Telling me all of my glories overdue,Ozzy
How many times have I heard it before,Ozzy
And I'll probably hear it again,Ozzy
"King of a thousand knights, pawn in a table light",Ozzy
Losing to you,Ozzy
And they don't really know even what they're talkin' about,Ozzy
And I can't image what empty heads can achieve,Ozzy
"Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more",Ozzy
'Cos rock & roll is my religion and my law,Ozzy
"Won't ever change, may think it's strange",Ozzy
"You can't kill rock & roll, it's here to stay",Ozzy
Even the rhymes that they,Ozzy
Give me in times of confession ain't true,Ozzy
Outcome is obvious,Ozzy
"All for them, none for us",Ozzy
Meaning you too,Ozzy
The things they will do and the things they will say,Ozzy
When they don't really understand,Ozzy
"Fear of rejection, I need their protection",Ozzy
I'm making a stand,Ozzy
'Cos they don't really know even what they're talkin' about,Ozzy
And I can't image what empty heads can achieve,Ozzy
"Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more",Ozzy
'Cos rock & roll is my religion and my law,Ozzy
"Won't ever change, may think it's strange",Ozzy
"You can't kill rock & roll, it's here to stay",Ozzy
"Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more",Ozzy
'Cos rock & roll is my religion and my law,Ozzy
"Won't ever change, may think it's strange",Ozzy
"I'm born to rock & roll, I'm here to stay, yeah",Ozzy
Watching the time go,Ozzy
And feeling belief grow,Ozzy
Rise above the obstacles,Ozzy
People beseech me,Ozzy
But they'll never teach me,Ozzy
Things that I already know (I know),Ozzy
Dreams that have shattered,Ozzy
May not have mattered,Ozzy
Take another point of view,Ozzy
"Doubts will arise, though",Ozzy
Like chasing a rainbow,Ozzy
I can tell a thing or two (That's true),Ozzy
You've got to believe in yourself,Ozzy
Or no one will believe in you,Ozzy
Imagination like a bird on the wing,Ozzy
Flying free for you to use (OK baby),Ozzy
I can't believe they stop and stare ,Ozzy
"And point their fingers, doubting me",Ozzy
Their disbelief suppresses them,Ozzy
But they're not blind,Ozzy
It's just that they won't see,Ozzy
I'm a believer,Ozzy
I ain't no deceiver,Ozzy
Mountains move before my eyes,Ozzy
Destiny planned out,Ozzy
I don't need no handout,Ozzy
Speculation of the wise,Ozzy
Wrything and screaming,Ozzy
The pain just won't go,Ozzy
He'll show you no mercy,Ozzy
Your image in his hands,Ozzy
It's useless to try,Ozzy
Escaping his curses,Ozzy
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls,Ozzy
Tortured and flaming,Ozzy
You give birth to hell,Ozzy
Living a nightmare,Ozzy
Feelings of pity,Ozzy
You'll pray for your death,Ozzy
But he's in no hurry,Ozzy
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls,Ozzy
Nowhere to run,Ozzy
Your fate is in his hands,Ozzy
Your time has come,Ozzy
You'll live to his command,Ozzy
I'm warning you,Ozzy
The worst is yet to come,Ozzy
The killer who,Ozzy
Remains a mystery,Ozzy
I that believe in,Ozzy
The stories of old ,Ozzy
Would never fight it,Ozzy
Vengeance and curses,Ozzy
That play on your soul,Ozzy
Like something ignited,Ozzy
You never imagined,Ozzy
Such a fate could follow you,Ozzy
(You never thought it was true),Ozzy
And when it's your time,Ozzy
I wonder how you'll do,Ozzy
Your kind of troubles,Ozzy
Running deeper than the sea,Ozzy
You broke the rules,Ozzy
You've been a fool,Ozzy
"The little doll is you, yeah",Ozzy
Nowhere to run,Ozzy
Your fate is in his hands,Ozzy
Your time has come,Ozzy
You'll live to his command,Ozzy
I'm warning you,Ozzy
The worst is yet to come,Ozzy
The killer who,Ozzy
Remains a mystery,Ozzy
Wrything and screaming,Ozzy
The pain just won't go,Ozzy
He'll show you no mercy,Ozzy
Your image in his hands,Ozzy
It's useless to try,Ozzy
Escaping his curses,Ozzy
Nowhere to run,Ozzy
Your fate is in his hands,Ozzy
Your time has come,Ozzy
You'll live to his command,Ozzy
I'm warning you,Ozzy
The worst is yet to come,Ozzy
The killer who,Ozzy
Remains a mystery,Ozzy
Now I'm back out on the street again,Ozzy
It never rains unless it pours,Ozzy
Try to get back on my feet again,Ozzy
I hear the raging thunder as it roars,Ozzy
"Tonight, tonight",Ozzy
Is it just a rhapsody,Ozzy
Or am I right?,Ozzy
"Tonight, tonight",Ozzy
Is it all a mystery?,Ozzy
I just can't fight no more,Ozzy
I hear the questions surface in my mind,Ozzy
Of my mistakes that I have made,Ozzy
Times and places I have left behind,Ozzy
And am I ever gonna make the grade?,Ozzy
"Tonight, tonight",Ozzy
Is it just a rhapsody,Ozzy
Or am I right?,Ozzy
"Tonight, tonight",Ozzy
Is it all a mystery?,Ozzy
I just can't fight no more,Ozzy
As I beat my head against the wall,Ozzy
Running 'round in circles in vain,Ozzy
I'm feeling three foot tall,Ozzy
You don't understand,Ozzy
I'm fading away,Ozzy
Don't want your pity or your sympathy,Ozzy
It isn't gonna prove a thing to me,Ozzy
Good intentions pave the way to hell,Ozzy

Brighter than the sun that's rising,Ozzy
Three thousand sails on high are straining in the wind,Ozzy
A raging sea below,Ozzy
Is this voyage coming to an end?,Ozzy
Screaming at the window,Ozzy

A sickened mind and spirit,Ozzy
The mirror tells me lies,Ozzy
Could I mistake myself for someone,Ozzy
Who lives behind my eyes?,Ozzy
Will he escape my soul,Ozzy
Or will he live in me?,Ozzy
Is he trying to get out,Ozzy
Or trying to enter me?,Ozzy
Voices in the darkness,Ozzy
Scream away my mental health,Ozzy
Can I ask a question,Ozzy
To help me save me from myself?,Ozzy

And control is still in view for a fool like you,Ozzy
That's true,Ozzy
Is there a reason for the way that you are,Ozzy
Or does it just come naturally?,Ozzy
To have an idiosyncrasy and be a fool like you,Ozzy
That's true,Ozzy
You're hearing what you want to hear,Ozzy
Misunderstanding all you see,Ozzy
An attitude in all of us,Ozzy

But I don't want to wear a broken crown,Ozzy
You know it brings me down,Ozzy
Don't think you'll ever understand me,Ozzy
I don't even understand me,Ozzy
Don't have the power to annoint you,Ozzy
And I don't want to disappoint,Ozzy
The fools no more,Ozzy
The fools no more,Ozzy
I couldn't answer all your questions,Ozzy
And if you're lost I couldn't find your way,Ozzy
I couldn't find your way,Ozzy
You know you have to face the music,Ozzy
You changed your tune and don't know what to play,Ozzy
So don't you run away,Ozzy
Everybody's talking crazy,Ozzy
Some think I am a devil maybe,Ozzy
I don't want to hear about it,Ozzy
Don't want to have to scream and shout,Ozzy
At fools no more,Ozzy
The fools no more,Ozzy
"So, I don't want to be a hero",Ozzy
Don't want to sit upon your crippled throne,Ozzy
I've got a life of my own,Ozzy
I am not your destination,Ozzy
Or a road that's gonna lead you home,Ozzy
"So, baby please don't go",Ozzy

In darkness I'm light years away,Ozzy
The voices come and go,Ozzy
Save me,Ozzy
All my life I've been a liar,Ozzy
Save me,Ozzy
All my life I've been a liar,Ozzy
Burning bridges in the rain,Ozzy
The crying embryo,Ozzy
I seem so blissfully insane,Ozzy
But still the pain won't go,Ozzy
Save me,Ozzy
All my life I've been a liar,Ozzy
Save me,Ozzy
All my life I've been a liar,Ozzy
Sacred words,Ozzy
The angels wait for me,Ozzy
They'll set me free,Ozzy
"But I can't see, the joke's on me",Ozzy
Babies crying,Ozzy
Other people's tears,Ozzy
And in their eyes,Ozzy
They have reflected wasted years,Ozzy
You ask me who I really am,Ozzy
I still say I don't know,Ozzy
The doors have all been tightly slammed,Ozzy
The poison seeds are sewn,Ozzy
Save me,Ozzy
All my life I've been a liar,Ozzy
Save me,Ozzy
All my life I've been a liar,Ozzy
Dying angels,Ozzy
Falling from above,Ozzy
I've had enough,Ozzy
I cannot laugh the joke's on me,Ozzy
Shattered dreams you cannot realize,Ozzy
"Won't sympathize, it's in your eyes",Ozzy
Why can't you see?,Ozzy
Am I the liar? Tell me who's the liar?,Ozzy

You're comin' home,Ozzy
There's blood on the walls,Ozzy
When Charlie and the family make house calls,Ozzy
If you're alone,Ozzy
Then watch what you do,Ozzy

"Paid for the kill, but it doesn't seem right",Ozzy
Something there I can't believe in,Ozzy
Voices are calling from inside my head,Ozzy
"I can hear them, I can hear them",Ozzy
Vanishing memories of things that were said,Ozzy
They can't try to hurt me now,Ozzy
But a shot in the dark,Ozzy
One step away from you,Ozzy
Just a shot in the dark,Ozzy
Always creeping up on you,Ozzy
All right,Ozzy
Taught by the powers that preach over me,Ozzy
I can hear their empty reasons,Ozzy
"I wouldn't listen, I learned how to fight",Ozzy
I opened up my mind to treason,Ozzy
"But just like the wounded, and when it's too late",Ozzy

I'm living on an endless road,Ozzy
Around the world for rock and roll,Ozzy
Sometimes it feels so tough,Ozzy
But I still ain't had enough,Ozzy
I keep saying that it's getting too much,Ozzy
But I know I'm a liar,Ozzy
Feeling all right,Ozzy
in the noise and the light,Ozzy
But that's what lights my fire,Ozzy
"Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat",Ozzy
"Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat",Ozzy
"Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true",Ozzy
"Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you",Ozzy
Walking out on another stage,Ozzy
"Another town, another place",Ozzy
Sometimes I don't feel right,Ozzy
Nerves wound up too damn tight,Ozzy
People keep telling me it's bad for my health,Ozzy
But kicking back don't make it,Ozzy
Out of control,Ozzy
I play the ultimate role,Ozzy
But that's what lights my fire,Ozzy

Time after time,Ozzy
I guess that love is blind,Ozzy
I couldn't read your mind,Ozzy
Line after line,Ozzy
Line after line,Ozzy
It was written in your eyes,Ozzy
I guess it's no surprise,Ozzy
Time after time,Ozzy
I can hear them whispering,Ozzy
Shadows in the rain,Ozzy
Thinking how it might have been,Ozzy
Time after time,Ozzy
"Line after line, you broke me",Ozzy
Day after day,Ozzy
I watched love fade away,Ozzy
I wanted love to stay,Ozzy
Day after day,Ozzy
The games we play,Ozzy
The foolish things we say,Ozzy
The pain won't go away,Ozzy
Day after day,Ozzy
Candlelight are shimmering,Ozzy
Shadows on the wall,Ozzy
Thinking how it might have been,Ozzy
I don't need no doctor,Ozzy
But I need something to kill the pain,Ozzy
Don't know what I'm after,Ozzy
But the pressure driving me insane,Ozzy
Searching for a differnt ride,Ozzy
Had a funny feeling I can't hide,Ozzy
"Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp",Ozzy
Why can't they just let me be,Ozzy
Alone without the misery,Ozzy
"Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie, Zombie Stomp",Ozzy
Flirting with disaster,Ozzy
Mornign after killing me again,Ozzy
Hiding from the laughter,Ozzy
And the demons dancing round my brain,Ozzy
Always dancing on thin ice,Ozzy
I guess I'll have to pay the price,Ozzy
"Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp",Ozzy
Thinking how it could have been,Ozzy
If I had never let them in,Ozzy
"Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie, Zombie Stomp",Ozzy
Take me to the doctor,Ozzy
'Cause I feel it coming on again,Ozzy
Don't know where I'm going,Ozzy
'Cause I guess I don't know where I've been,Ozzy
Looking for a different ride,Ozzy
Always dancing on thin ice,Ozzy
"Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie Stomp",Ozzy
Thinking how it could have been,Ozzy
If I had never let them in,Ozzy
"Hey, Hey, Do the Zombie, Zombie Stomp",Ozzy
I get up and I get down,Ozzy
I don't know how to take it,Ozzy
All the pain makes me scream and shout,Ozzy
I wonder if I'll make it,Ozzy
I love the feeling when the magic is just right,Ozzy
There's no revealing what is hidden in the night,Ozzy
Riding on a train that I can't control,Ozzy
No one else to blame and I can't let go,Ozzy
In the darkness I can feel,Ozzy
The things that makes me crazy,Ozzy
Hands of madness cold as steel,Ozzy
I find it quite amazing,Ozzy
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know,Ozzy
Rules meant for breaking and the seeds I have to sow,Ozzy
Riding on a train that I can't control,Ozzy
No one else to blame and I can't let go,Ozzy
"It's calling me, It's calling me",Ozzy
"It's calling me, It's calling me",Ozzy
I'm riding on a train that I can't control,Ozzy
"See no evil, fear no fright",Ozzy
Never lose the living,Ozzy
Keep the targets in your sight,Ozzy
Know the cards you're dealing,Ozzy
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know,Ozzy
"Rules meant for breaking and I gotta let, I gotta it go",Ozzy
I was looking back on my life,Ozzy
And all the things I've done to me,Ozzy
I'm still looking for the answers,Ozzy
I'm still searching for the key,Ozzy
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me,Ozzy
It just won't leave me alone,Ozzy
I still find it all a mystery,Ozzy
Could it be a dream?,Ozzy
The Road To Nowhere leads to me,Ozzy
Through all the happiness and sorrow,Ozzy
I guess I'd do it all again,Ozzy
Live for today and not tomorrow,Ozzy
It's still the road that never ends,Ozzy
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me,Ozzy
It just won't leave me alone,Ozzy
I still find it all a mystery,Ozzy
Could it be a dream?,Ozzy
The Road To Nowhere leads to me,Ozzy
Ah Ah,Ozzy

I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through,Ozzy
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now,Ozzy
I told them I had ridden shooting stars,Ozzy
And said I'd show them how,Ozzy
Over and over always tried to get away,Ozzy
Living in a daydream only place I had to stay,Ozzy
Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide,Ozzy
People around me talking to the walls inside,Ozzy
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now,Ozzy
I told them I had ridden shooting stars,Ozzy
And said I'd show them how,Ozzy
"Don't need no astrology, it's inside of you and me",Ozzy
"You don't need a ticket to fly with me, I'm free",Ozzy
Over and under in between the ups and downs,Ozzy
Mind on a carpet magic ride goes round and round,Ozzy
Over the mountain kissing silver inlaid clouds,Ozzy
Watching my body disappear into the crowd,Ozzy
Finished with my woman cause she couldn't help me with my mind,Ozzy
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,Ozzy
"All day long I think of things, but nothing seems to satisfy",Ozzy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify,Ozzy
Can you help me... occupy my brain,Ozzy
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find,Ozzy
I can't see the things that make true happiness I must be blind,Ozzy
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry,Ozzy
Happiness I can not feel and love to me is so unreal,Ozzy
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state,Ozzy
"I tell you to enjoy your life, I wish I could but it's too late",Ozzy
Screams break the silence,Ozzy
Waking from the dead of night,Ozzy
Vengeance is boiling,Ozzy
He's returned to kill the light,Ozzy
Then when he's found who he's looking for,Ozzy
Listen in awe and you'll hear him,Ozzy
Bark at the moon,Ozzy
Years spent in torment,Ozzy
Buried in a nameless grave,Ozzy
Now he has risen,Ozzy
Miracles would have to save,Ozzy
Those that the beast is looking for,Ozzy
Listen in awe and you'll hear him,Ozzy
Bark at the moon,Ozzy
They cursed and buried him along with shame,Ozzy
And thought his timeless soul had gone,Ozzy
"In empty burning hell, unholy one",Ozzy
"But now he's returned to prove them wrong, so wrong",Ozzy
Howling in shadows,Ozzy
Living in a lunar spell,Ozzy
He finds his heaven,Ozzy
Spewing from the mouth of hell,Ozzy
Those that the beast is looking for,Ozzy
Listen in awe and you'll hear him,Ozzy
Bark at the moon,Ozzy
Out on the street I'm stalking the night,Ozzy
I can hear my heavy breathing,Ozzy
Paid for the kill but it doesn't seem right,Ozzy
Something there I can't believe in,Ozzy
Voices are calling from inside my head,Ozzy
"I can hear them, I can hear them",Ozzy
Vanishing memories of things that were said,Ozzy
They can't try to hurt me now,Ozzy
But a shot in the dark one step away from you,Ozzy
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you,Ozzy
Taught by the powers that preach over me,Ozzy
I can hear their empty reason,Ozzy
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight,Ozzy
I opened up my mind to treason,Ozzy
But just like the wounded and when it's too late,Ozzy
"They'll remember, they'll surrender",Ozzy
Never a care for that people who hate,Ozzy
Underestimate me now,Ozzy
But a shot in the dark one step away from you,Ozzy
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do,Ozzy
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you,Ozzy
But just like the wounded and when it's too late,Ozzy
"They'll remember, they'll surrender",Ozzy
Never a care for the people who hate,Ozzy
Underestimate me now,Ozzy
But a shot in the dark one step away from you,Ozzy
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do,Ozzy
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you,Ozzy
Just a shot in the dark,Ozzy
Crazy...babies,Ozzy
Crazy babies never say die,Ozzy
Born to live on a permanent high,Ozzy
Flying high above the world below,Ozzy
They'd better come down soon or everyone will know just why,Ozzy
"Nobody's gonna change them, change them",Ozzy
They've gone over the top,Ozzy
"Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them",Ozzy
They're never gonna stop,Ozzy
Walk that walk... talk that talk,Ozzy
Crazy...babies,Ozzy
When they were born they were born to be wild,Ozzy
Some say I'm another devil's child,Ozzy
Crazy babies in a world of their own,Ozzy
I am a crazy babe you'd better leave me alone tonight,Ozzy
"Nobody's gonna change me, change me",Ozzy
I'm gonna do this 'til I die,Ozzy
"Nobody's gonna tame me, tame me",Ozzy
So you better not try,Ozzy
Walk that walk... talk that talk,Ozzy
Crazy...babies,Ozzy
No use talkin 'bout if they'll last,Ozzy
Where they're goin' or about their past,Ozzy
They're just the result of our Society,Ozzy
"So frustrated just like you and me, that's right",Ozzy
"Nobody's gonna change them, change them",Ozzy
They've gone over the top,Ozzy
"Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them",Ozzy
They're never gonna stop,Ozzy
The light in the window is a crack in the sky,Ozzy
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye,Ozzy
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back,Ozzy
The man in the dark will bring another attack,Ozzy
Your momma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers,Ozzy
Look in the mirror tell me do you think your life's in danger here,Ozzy
No more tears,Ozzy
Another day passes as the night closes in,Ozzy
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin,Ozzy
"I see the man around the corner waiting, does he see me?",Ozzy
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here,Ozzy
No more tears,Ozzy
"So now that it's over, can't we just say goodbye?",Ozzy
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night,Ozzy
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way,Ozzy
Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say,Ozzy
I never wanted it to end this way my love my darling,Ozzy
Believe me when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here,Ozzy
No more tears,Ozzy
Times have changed and times are strange,Ozzy
"Here I come, but I ain't the same",Ozzy
"Mama, I'm coming home",Ozzy
"Times gone by, seems to be",Ozzy
You could have been a better friend to me,Ozzy
"Mama, I'm coming home",Ozzy
You took me in and you drove me out,Ozzy
"Yeah, you had me hypnotized",Ozzy
Lost and found and turned around,Ozzy
By the fire in your eyes,Ozzy
"You made me cry, you told me lies",Ozzy
"But, I can't stand to say goodbye",Ozzy
"Mama, I'm coming home",Ozzy
"I could be right, I could be wrong",Ozzy
"It hurts so bad, it's been so long",Ozzy
"Mama, I'm coming home",Ozzy
"Selfish love, yeah, we're both alone",Ozzy
"The ride before the fall, yeah.",Ozzy
But I'm gonna take this heart of stone,Ozzy

Looking to the mirror,Ozzy
From the other side,Ozzy
Seeing her reflection,Ozzy
And it blows my mind,Ozzy
Trying to deny it,Ozzy
But damage is done,Ozzy
I'll just run as always,Ozzy
But the race is run,Ozzy
You've got to tell me it's over now,Ozzy
I'm trapped inside of a dream,Ozzy
The crushing weight on my shoulders now,Ozzy
Is bearing down and it seems,Ozzy
There's just no easy way out,Ozzy
No easy way out,Ozzy

Distant voices cry,Ozzy
Is there light in me,Ozzy
Tell me what you see,Ozzy
You are what I have,Ozzy
Can't get something that I never had,Ozzy
Can't get something that I never had,Ozzy
